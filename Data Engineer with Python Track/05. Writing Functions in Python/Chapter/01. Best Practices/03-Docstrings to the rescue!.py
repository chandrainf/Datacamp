Docstrings to the rescue!


Some maniac has corrupted your installation of numpy! All of the functions still exist, but they've been given random names. You desperately need to call the numpy.histogram() function and you don't have time to reinstall the package. Fortunately for you, the maniac didn't think to alter the docstrings, and you know how to access them. numpy has a lot of functions in it, so we've narrowed it down to four possible functions that could be numpy.histogram() in disguise: numpy.leyud(), numpy.uqka(), numpy.fywdkxa() or numpy.jinzyxq().

Examine each of these functions' docstrings in the IPython shell to determine which of them is actually numpy.histogram().
