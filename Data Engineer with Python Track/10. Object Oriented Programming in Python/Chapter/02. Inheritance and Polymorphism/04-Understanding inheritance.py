Understanding inheritance
Inheritance is a powerful tool of object-oriented languages that allows you to customize functionality of existing classes without having to re-implement methods from scratch.

In this exercise you'll check your understanding of the basics of inheritance. In the questions, we'll make use of the following two classes:

class Counter:
    def __init__(self, count):
       self.count = count

    def add_counts(self, n):
       self.count += n

class Indexer(Counter):
   pass
