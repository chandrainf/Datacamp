Sending an alert


Elena Block, Sam's old friend and council member is running for office and potholes are a big deal in her district. She wants to help fix it.

Pothole
Elena asked Sam to adjust the streets_critical topic to send an alert if there are over 100 unfixed potholes in the backlog.

Sam has created the boto3 SNS client in the sns variable. She stored the streets_critical topic ARN in the str_critical_arn variable.

Help Sam take the next step.

She needs to check the current backlog count and send a message only if it exceeds 100.

The fate of District 12, and the results of Elena's election rest on your and Sam's shoulders.
