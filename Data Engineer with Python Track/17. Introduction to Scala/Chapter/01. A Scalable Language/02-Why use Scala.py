Why use Scala?


Scala is a portmanteau for "scalable language" as it was designed to grow with the demands of its users, from writing small scripts to building massive systems for data processing, distributed computing, and more. Like a bazaar and unlike a cathedral, Scala is designed to be adapted and extended by the people working (programming) in it.

Analogies help us form mental models by transferring knowledge from a known domain to an unknown domain. In this exercise, you'll categorize well-known things as scalable or not to reinforce your instinctual answer to "Why use Scala?"
