Unit test a ValueError


Sometimes, you want a function to raise an exception when called on bad arguments. This prevents the function from returning nonsense results or hard-to-interpret exceptions. This is an important behavior which should be unit tested.

Remember the function split_into_training_and_testing_sets()? It takes a NumPy array containing housing area and prices as argument. The function randomly splits the array row wise into training and testing arrays in the ratio 3:1, and returns the resulting arrays in a tuple.

If the argument array has only 1 row, the testing array will be empty. To avoid this situation, you want the function to not return anything, but raise a ValueError with the message "Argument data_array must have at least 2 rows, it actually has just 1".

- Fill in with the correct context manager that checks if split_into_training_and_testing_sets() raises a ValueError when called on test_argument, which is a NumPy array with a single row.

'''
import numpy as np
import pytest
from train import split_into_training_and_testing_sets


def test_on_one_row():
    test_argument = np.array([[1382.0, 390167.0]])
    # Fill in with a context manager for checking ValueError
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        split_into_training_and_testing_sets(test_argument)

Complete the with statement so that information about any raised ValueError will be stored in the variable exc_info.

'''
import numpy as np
import pytest
from train import split_into_training_and_testing_sets
def test_on_one_row():
    test_argument = np.array([[1382.0, 390167.0]])
    # Store information about raised ValueError in exc_info
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
        split_into_training_and_testing_sets(test_argument)

Write an assert statement to check if the raised ValueError contains the correct message stored in the variable expected_error_msg.

'''

import numpy as np
import pytest
def test_on_one_row():
    test_argument = np.array([[1382.0, 390167.0]])
    # Store information about raised ValueError in exc_info
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
        split_into_training_and_testing_sets(test_argument)
    expected_error_msg = "Argument data_array must have at least 2 rows, it actually has just 1"
    # Check if the raised ValueError contains the correct message
    assert exc_info.match(expected_error_msg)

Question

The test test_on_one_row() was written to the test module test_split_into_training_and_testing_sets.py. Run the test in the IPython console and read the test result report. Does the test pass or fail?

Possible Answers

    - The test passes.

    - The test fails because no ValueError is raised when split_into_training_and_testing_sets() is called on a NumPy array with 1 row.

    - The test fails because the ValueError does not contain the correct error message.

Answer : The test passes.
