Data pipelines are used to process data. At the end of Chapter 1, you learned about ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), one of the frameworks used to build data pipelines. The data processing tasks you just studied actually match that framework, corresponding to either extraction, transformation or loading operations.

Note that although saving and loading are usually considered to be opposites, in the context of data engineering, they are the same thing, as you may have noticed. The reason for this is that when you're saving something, you're just storing it in the next step in the pipeline.

Can you correctly classify data processing tasks as extraction, transformation, or loading operations?
