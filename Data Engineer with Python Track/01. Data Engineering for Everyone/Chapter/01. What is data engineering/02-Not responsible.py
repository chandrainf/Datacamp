Not responsible


You recently joined the data science team as a manager for a music streaming company named Spotflix. It's a music platform that lets users stream songs, create playlists, follow artists, watch music videos and even look up lyrics!

One of your colleagues just walked to your desk. They just got hired, but they already know you're on the data team - after training with DataCamp, you've made a name for yourself pretty quick! They have a bunch of data tasks they need completed, and they want to make sure they ask the right person. You tell them you can help them identify what they should request from data engineers, and what they should not.

Can you deliver on this promise?
