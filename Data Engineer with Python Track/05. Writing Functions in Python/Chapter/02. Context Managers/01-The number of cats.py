'''
The number of cats


You are working on a natural language processing project to determine what makes great writers so great. Your current hypothesis is that great writers talk about cats a lot. To prove it, you want to count the number of times the word "cat" appears in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll. You have already downloaded a text file, alice.txt, with the entire contents of this great book.

Instructions

- Use the open() context manager to open alice.txt and assign the file to the file variable.

'''
# Open "alice.txt" and assign the file to "file"
with open('alice.txt') as file:
    text = file.read()

n = 0
for word in text.split():
    if word.lower() in ['cat', 'cats']:
        n += 1

print('Lewis Carroll uses the word "cat" {} times'.format(n))
