Make your columns UNIQUE with ADD CONSTRAINT


As seen in the video, you add the UNIQUE keyword after the column_name that should be unique. This, of course, only works for new tables:

    CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name UNIQUE
    );

If you want to add a unique constraint to an existing table, you do it like that:

    ALTER TABLE table_name
    ADD CONSTRAINT some_name UNIQUE(column_name);

Note that this is different from the ALTER COLUMN syntax for the not-null constraint. Also, you have to give the constraint a name some_name.
