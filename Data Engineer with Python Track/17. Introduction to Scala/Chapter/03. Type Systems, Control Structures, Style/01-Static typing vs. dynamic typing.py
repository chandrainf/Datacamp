Static typing vs. dynamic typing


Scala's static type system helps avoid bugs in complex applications. Though static typing is a core part of the essence of Scala, the concept of a type system can be hard to grasp.

In this exercise, you'll categorize various ways of saying the same thing about statically-typed languages and dynamically-typed languages to understand these terms from all angles. Example: run time is a synonym for execution time.

The following definitions may be helpful:

Type: restricts the possible values to which a variable can refer, or an expression can produce, at run time.

Compile time: when source code is translated into machine code, i.e., code that a computer can read.

Run time: when the program is executing commands (after compilation, if compiled).
