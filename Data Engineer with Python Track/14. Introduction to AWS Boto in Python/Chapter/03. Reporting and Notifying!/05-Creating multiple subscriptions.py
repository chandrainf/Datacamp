Creating multiple subscriptions


After the successful pilot with Councilwoman Elena Block, other City Council members have been asking to be signed up for alerts too.

Sam decides that she should manage subscribers in a CSV file, otherwise she would lose track of who needs to be subscribed to what.

She creates a CSV named contacts and decides to subscribe everyone in the CSV to the streets_critical topic.

She has created the boto3 SNS client in the sns variable, and the streets_critical topic ARN is in the str_critical_arn variable.

Sam is going from being a social pariah to being courted by multiple council offices.

Help her solidify her position as master of all information by adding all the users in her CSV to the streets_critical topic!
