Attribute naming conventions


In Python, all data is public. Instead of access modifiers common in languages like Java, Python uses naming conventions to communicate the developer's intention to class users, shifting the responsibility of safe class use onto the class user.

Python uses underscores extensively to signal the purpose of methods and attributes. In this exercise, you will match a use case with the appropriate naming convention.
