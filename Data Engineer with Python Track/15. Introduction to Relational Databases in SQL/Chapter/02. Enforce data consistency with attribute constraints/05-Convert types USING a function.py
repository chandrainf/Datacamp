'''
Convert types USING a function


If you don't want to reserve too much space for a certain varchar column, you can truncate the values before converting its type.

For this, you can use the following syntax:

    ALTER TABLE table_name
    ALTER COLUMN column_name
    TYPE varchar(x)
    USING SUBSTRING(column_name FROM 1 FOR x)

You should read it like this: Because you want to reserve only x characters for column_name, you have to retain a SUBSTRING of every value, i.e. the first x characters of it, and throw away the rest. This way, the values will fit the varchar(x) requirement.

- Run the sample code as is and take note of the error.
- Now use SUBSTRING() to reduce firstname to 16 characters so its type can be altered to varchar(16).

'''
-- Convert the values in firstname to a max. of 16 characters
ALTER TABLE professors
ALTER COLUMN firstname
TYPE varchar(16)
USING SUBSTRING(firstname FROM 1 FOR 16)
