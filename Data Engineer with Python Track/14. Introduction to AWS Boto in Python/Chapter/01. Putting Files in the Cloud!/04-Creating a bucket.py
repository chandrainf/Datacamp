Creating a bucket


Sam is dipping her toes in the water, getting ready to build her first pipeline.

Get It Done is the app the City released for residents to report problems. There are lots of problems to report, and lots of data gets generated.

Get It Done services poster

She will be picking up daily reports generated by Get It Done and placing them in the 'gim-staging' bucket. Then, she will clean the data and place the new dataset in the 'gim-processed' bucket.

She also wants to create a 'gim-test' bucket to experiment with.

Help Sam take the first step to her pipeline dreams. Help her create her first bucket, 'gim-staging'!
