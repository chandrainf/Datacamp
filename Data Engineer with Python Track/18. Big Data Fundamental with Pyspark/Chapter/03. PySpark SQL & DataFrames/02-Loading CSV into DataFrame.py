'''
Loading CSV into DataFrame


In the previous exercise, you have seen a method of creating DataFrame but generally, loading data from CSV file is the most common method of creating DataFrames. In this exercise, you'll create a PySpark DataFrame from a people.csv file that is already provided to you as a file_path and confirm the created object is a PySpark DataFrame.

Remember, you already have SparkSession spark and file_path variable (which is the path to the people.csv file) available in your workspace.
