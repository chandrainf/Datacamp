Upload aggregated reports for February


In the last exercise, Sam downloaded the files for the month from the raw data bucket.

Then she combined them all into one DataFrame that showcases all of the month's requests and requests type.

She stored this DataFrame in the variable all_reqs and used pandas's groupby functionality to count requests by service name, generating a new DataFrame agg_df:

    service_name	            count
0	72 Hour Violation	        2910
1	Chain Link Fence Repair	    90
2	Collections Truck Spill	    30
3	Container Left Out	        120
4	Dead Animal	                360

She has already created the boto3 S3 client in the s3 variable.

Help her publish this month's request statistics.

Write agg_df to CSV and HTML files, and upload them to S3 as public files.

Instructions

- Write CSV and HTML versions of agg_df and name them 'feb_final_report.csv' and 'feb_final_report.html' respectively.
- Upload both versions of agg_df to the gid-reports bucket and set them to public read.
