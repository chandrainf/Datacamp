Upload an HTML file to S3


When the Streets Operations manager heard of what Sam has been working on, he asked her to build him a dashboard of Get It Done requests.

He wants to use the dashboard to staff and schedule his team accordingly.

Sam generated a nice dashboard html file with the Python bokeh charting library:

Bokeh Plot

She wants to serve it as a website, providing an interactive dashboard to members of Streets Operations.

Letting S3 serve the dashboard as a site lets her write a script that continuously updates the generated HTML file and keeps the Streets Operations team updated on the latest requests.

She has already initialized the boto3 S3 client and assigned it to the s3 variable.
