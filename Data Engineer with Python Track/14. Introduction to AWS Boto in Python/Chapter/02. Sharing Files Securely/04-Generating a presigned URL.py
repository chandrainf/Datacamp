Generating a presigned URL


Sam got a special request from City Council to analyze whether the City is prioritizing requests in District 11, while de-prioritizing requests in the less affluent district 12. They asked her to keep this report confidential, as they would like to see it before it goes public to the media.

Sam has generated the report and is ready to share it with the City council, but making it public makes her too paranoid. She decided to provide the Council with a presigned URL so they can temporarily access the report for 1 hour.

She has already initialized the boto3 S3 client and assigned it to the s3 variable.

Help her generate a presigned URL valid for 1 hour to 'final_report.csv' in the 'gid-staging' bucket. Then, print it out for the City Council!

Instructions
