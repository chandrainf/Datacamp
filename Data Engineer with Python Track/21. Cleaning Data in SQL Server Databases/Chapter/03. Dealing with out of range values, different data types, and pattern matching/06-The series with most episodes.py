'''
The series with most episodes


In the episodes table, there is a column named number. It stores the number of each episode within a season for every series. This column was designed as VARCHAR(5), but it actually stores numbers.

Can you guess which is the series with most episodes within a season?

Note: To get the name of the series you will need to perform an INNER JOIN between series and episodes, matching the columns series.id with episodes.series_id.
