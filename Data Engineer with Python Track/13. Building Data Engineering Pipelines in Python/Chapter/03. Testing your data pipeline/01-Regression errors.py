Regression errors


A common software versioning system is called “semantic versioning” or “semver”. In it, three numbers, separated by dots, specify the version. The first number is increased whenever there are major changes, like between Python 2.x.y and Python 3.u.v. Whenever there are minor changes, like newly added features, the second number is increased, e.g. 3.1.2 and 3.2.0. The last number is used when bugfixes are made on a minor release. The changes are too small to require lots of documentation then.

A piece of software from your organization is released, as version 2.3.1. One of the users of this software quickly files a complaint stating that the software no longer gives him the correct output for a routine task, compared to the software’s previous version, 2.3.0.

What conclusions can you draw?
