'''
FORMATMESSAGE with message string


Every time you sell a bike in your store, you need to check if there is enough stock. You prepare a script to check it and throw an error if there is not enough stock.

Today, you sold 10 'Trek CrossRip+ - 2018' bikes, so you need to check if you can sell them.
