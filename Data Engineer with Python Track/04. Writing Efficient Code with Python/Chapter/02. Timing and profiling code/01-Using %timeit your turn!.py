Using %timeit: your turn!


You'd like to create a list of integers from 0 to 50 using the range() function. However, you are unsure whether using list comprehension or unpacking the range object into a list is faster. Let's use %timeit to find the best implementation.

For your convenience, a reference table of time orders of magnitude is provided below (faster at the top).

    symbol	name	        unit (s)
    ns	    nanosecond	    10-9
    Âµs      (us)	        microsecond	10-6
    ms	    millisecond	    10-3
    s	    second	        100

- Use list comprehension and range() to create a list of integers from 0 to 50 called nums_list_comp

'''
# Create a list of integers (0-50) using list comprehension
nums_list_comp = [num for num in range(51)]
print(nums_list_comp)

-Use range() to create a list of integers from 0 to 50 and unpack its contents into a list called nums_unpack.

'''
# Create a list of integers (0-50) using list comprehension
nums_list_comp = [num for num in range(51)]
print(nums_list_comp)

# Create a list of integers (0-50) by unpacking range
nums_unpack = [*range(51)]
print(nums_unpack)

Question

Use %timeit within your IPython console (i.e. not within the script.py window) to compare the runtimes for creating a list of integers from 0 to 50 using list comprehension vs. unpacking the range object. Don't include the print() statements when timing.

Which method was faster?

Possible Answers

    - List comprehension was faster than unpacking range().

    - Unpacking the range object was faster than list comprehension.

    - Both methods had the same runtime.

Answer : Unpacking the range object was faster than list comprehension.
