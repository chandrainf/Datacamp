You've just seen some examples of pipelines used at Spotflix. Let's have you build one!

Our data engineer, Vivian, is working on building new pipelines to generate a new product: the Weekly Playlist. It's a playlist that is created by our system every day to recommend new songs that users might like based on their tastes.

On the right, you will find some steps. Can you order the steps correctly to help her build the pipeline generating a Weekly Playlist for each user? Let's start with one user, and build a pipeline to generate a Weekly Playlist for Julian, our data scientist.
