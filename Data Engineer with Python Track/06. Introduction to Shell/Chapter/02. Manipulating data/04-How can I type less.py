How can I type less?


One of the shell's power tools is tab completion. If you start typing the name of a file and then press the tab key, the shell will do its best to auto-complete the path. For example, if you type sea and press tab, it will fill in the directory name seasonal/ (with a trailing slash). If you then type a and tab, it will complete the path as seasonal/autumn.csv.

If the path is ambiguous, such as seasonal/s, pressing tab a second time will display a list of possibilities. Typing another character or two to make your path more specific and then pressing tab will fill in the rest of the name.
