What makes Scala scalable?


The scalability of a language depends on several factors. The creator of the language (Martin Odersky), however, believes there are two main factors that contribute the most to Scala being scalable: Scala being object-oriented and Scala being functional.

In this exercise, you'll demonstrate your knowledge of what each factor means by classifying statements about them.
