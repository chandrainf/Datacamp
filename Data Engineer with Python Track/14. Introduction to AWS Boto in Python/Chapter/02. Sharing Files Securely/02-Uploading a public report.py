Uploading a public report


As you saw in Chapter 1, Get It Done is an App that lets residents report problems like potholes and broken sidewalks.


The data from the app is a very hot topic political issue. Residents keep saying that the City does not distribute work evenly across neighborhoods when issues are reported. The City Council wants to be transparent with the public and has asked Sam to publish the aggregated Get It Done reports and make them publicly available.

Sam has initialized the boto3 S3 client and assigned it to the s3 variable.

In this exercise, you will help her increase government transparency by uploading public reports to the gid-staging bucket.
