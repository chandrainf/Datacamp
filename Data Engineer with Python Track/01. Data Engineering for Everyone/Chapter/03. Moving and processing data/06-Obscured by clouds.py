Obscured by clouds


Sasha, the new data engineer intern, is now trying to convince you that cloud computing and multicloud computing have absolutely no downsides. You disagree: you know for a fact that this is not true. It makes you question whether or not she is actually comfortable with the topic.

Once again, you take your manager role to heart and try to help her improve her understanding. You ask her to tell you their assumptions about cloud computing: you will tell her if she's right or wrong, and try to explain why. Are you up to the challenge?
