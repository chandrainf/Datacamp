A script is a sequence of instructions in a file that are executed sequentially. When you clicked "Run Code" and "Submit Answer" in previous exercises, you actually ran a Scala script!

On your own computer, you won't have access to the "Run Code" and "Submit Answer" buttons like you do in exercises on DataCamp.

In this exercise, you will order the workflow for creating and running a Scala script on your own computer.
