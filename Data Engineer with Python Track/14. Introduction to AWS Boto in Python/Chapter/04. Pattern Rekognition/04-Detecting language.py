She has already loaded the CSV into the dumping_df variable and subset it to the following columns:

Get It Done requests in many languages

# For each dataframe row
for index, row in dumping_df.iterrows():
    # Get the public description field
    description = dumping_df.loc[index, 'public_description']
    if description != '':
        # Detect language in the field content
        resp = comprehend.detect_dominant_language(Text=description)
        # Assign the top choice language to the lang column.
        dumping_df.loc[index, 'lang'] = resp['Languages'][0]['LanguageCode']

# Count the total number of spanish posts
spanish_post_ct = len(dumping_df[dumping_df.lang == 'es'])
# Print the result
print("{} posts in Spanish".format(spanish_post_ct))
