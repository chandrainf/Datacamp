'''
Update index to include February


In the previous two exercises, Sam has:

- Read the daily Get It Done request logs for February.
- Combined them into a single DataFrame.
- Generated a DataFrame with aggregated metrics (request counts by type)
- Wrote that DataFrame to a CSV and HTML final report files.
- Uploaded these files to S3.
Now, she wants these files to be accessible through the directory listing. Currently, it only shows links for January reports: Screenshot of Get It Done reports listing

She has created the boto3 S3 client and stored it in the s3 variable.

Help Sam generate a new directory listing with the February's uploaded reports and store it in a DataFrame.

# List the gid-reports bucket objects starting with 2019/
objects_list = s3.list_objects(Bucket='gid-reports', Prefix='2019/')

# Convert the response contents to DataFrame
objects_df = pd.DataFrame(objects_list['Contents'])

# Create a column "Link" that contains Public Object URL
base_url = "http://gid-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/"
objects_df['Link'] = base_url + objects_df['Key']

# Preview the resulting DataFrame
objects_df.head()
