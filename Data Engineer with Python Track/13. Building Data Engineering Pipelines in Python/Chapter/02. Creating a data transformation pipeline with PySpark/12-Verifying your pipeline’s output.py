Verifying your pipelineâ€™s output


After your successful execution of the clean_ratings PySpark job in an earlier exercise, using spark-submit, you want to verify whether it actually created files in the right location.

Verify that the files have been created by listing the contents of the directory where you stored them (/home/repl/workspace/mnt/data_lake/clean/product_ratings). How many parquet files have been created?
