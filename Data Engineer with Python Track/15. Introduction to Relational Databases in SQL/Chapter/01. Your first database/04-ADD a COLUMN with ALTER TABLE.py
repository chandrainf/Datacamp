ADD a COLUMN with ALTER TABLE


Oops! We forgot to add the university_shortname column to the professors table. You've probably already noticed:



In chapter 4 of this course, you'll need this column for connecting the professors table with the universities table.

However, adding columns to existing tables is easy, especially if they're still empty.

To add columns you can use the following SQL query:

    ALTER TABLE table_name
    ADD COLUMN column_name data_type;
