How can I identify files and directories?


pwd tells you where you are. To find out what's there, type ls (which is short for "listing") and press the enter key. On its own, ls lists the contents of your current directory (the one displayed by pwd). If you add the names of some files, ls will list them, and if you add the names of directories, it will list their contents. For example, ls /home/repl shows you what's in your starting directory (usually called your home directory).

Use ls with an appropriate argument to list the files in the directory /home/repl/seasonal (which holds information on dental surgeries by date, broken down by season). Which of these files is not in that directory?
