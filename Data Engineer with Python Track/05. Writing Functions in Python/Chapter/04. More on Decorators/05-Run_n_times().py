Run_n_times()


In the video exercise, I showed you an example of a decorator that takes an argument: run_n_times(). The code for that decorator is repeated below to remind you how it works. Practice different ways of applying the decorator to the function print_sum(). Then I'll show you a funny prank you can play on your co-workers.

  def run_n_times(n):
    """Define and return a decorator"""
    def decorator(func):
      def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        for i in range(n):
          func(*args, **kwargs)
      return wrapper
    return decorator

- Add the run_n_times() decorator to print_sum() using decorator syntax so that print_sum() runs 10 times.

'''
# Make print_sum() run 10 times with the run_n_times() decorator
@run_n_times(10)
def print_sum(a, b):
    print(a + b)


print_sum(15, 20)

-Use run_n_times() to create a decorator run_five_times() that will run any function five times.

'''
# Use run_n_times() to create the run_five_times() decorator
run_five_times = run_n_times(5)


@run_five_times
def print_sum(a, b):
    print(a + b)


print_sum(4, 100)

-Here's the prank: use run_n_times() to modify the built-in print() function so that it always prints 20 times!

'''
# Modify the print() function to always run 20 times
print = run_n_times(20)(print)

print('What is happening?!?!')
