Signs of style


Scala is a hybrid imperative/functional language. Imperative-style Scala code often has the following traits:

    - One command at a time
    - Iterate with loops
    - Mutate shared state (e.g., mutating variables out of scope)

Functional-style Scala code often has the following traits:

    - Functions are used as first-class values
    - Operations of a program map input values to output values rather than change data in place

In this exercise, you'll categorize items as either a sign of imperative- or functional-style code. Knowing these signs now will inform the code you write in the future when you wish to utilize a certain style. The following definition may be helpful:

Side effect: code that modifies some variable outside of its local scope.
