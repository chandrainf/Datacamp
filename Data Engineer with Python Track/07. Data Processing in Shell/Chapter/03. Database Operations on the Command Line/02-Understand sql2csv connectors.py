Understand sql2csv connectors


Suppose you have a SQL database you would like to connect to using sql2csv, but you're not sure yet if this particular database can be connected to. sql2csv's manual does not readily have the list of possible database connectors, but csvsql does!

Could you use csvsql's manual to check what SQL database connections are currently NOT supported for sql2csv and for the rest of the csvkit suite?
