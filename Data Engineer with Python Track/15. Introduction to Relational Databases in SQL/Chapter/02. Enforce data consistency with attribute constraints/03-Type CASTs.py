Type CASTs


In the video, you saw that type casts are a possible solution for data type issues. If you know that a certain column stores numbers as text, you can cast the column to a numeric form, i.e. to integer.

    SELECT CAST(some_column AS integer)
    FROM table;
    
Now, the some_column column is temporarily represented as integer instead of text, meaning that you can perform numeric calculations on the column.
