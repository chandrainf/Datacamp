Alternative constructors


Python allows you to define class methods as well, using the @classmethod decorator and a special first argument cls. The main use of class methods is defining methods that return an instance of the class, but aren't using the same code as __init__().

For example, you are developing a time series package and want to define your own class for working with dates, BetterDate. The attributes of the class will be year, month, and day. You want to have a constructor that creates BetterDate objects given the values for year, month, and day, but you also want to be able to create BetterDate objects from strings like 2020-04-30.

You might find the following functions useful:

    -.split("-") method will split a string at"-" into an array, e.g. "2020-04-30".split("-") returns ["2020", "04", "30"],
    -int() will convert a string into a number, e.g. int("2019") is 2019 .

Add a class method from_str() that:

- accepts a string datestr of the format'YYYY-MM-DD',
- splits datestr and converts each part into an integer,
- returns an instance of the class with the attributes set to the values extracted from datestr.

'''
class BetterDate:
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, year, month, day):
        # Recall that Python allows multiple variable assignments in one line
        self.year, self.month, self.day = year, month, day

    # Define a class method from_str
    @classmethod
    def from_str(cls, datestr):
        # Split the string at "-" and convert each part to integer
        parts = datestr.split("-")
        year, month, day = int(parts[0]), int(parts[1]), int(parts[2])
        # Return the class instance
        return BetterDate(year, month, day)


bd = BetterDate.from_str('2020-04-30')
print(bd.year)
print(bd.month)
print(bd.day)

For compatibility, you also want to be able to convert a datetime object into a BetterDate object.

-Add a class method from_datetime() that accepts a datetime object as the argument, and uses its attributes .year, .month and .day to create a BetterDate object with the same attribute values.

'''
# import datetime from datetime
from datetime import datetime

class BetterDate:
    def __init__(self, year, month, day):
        self.year, self.month, self.day = year, month, day

    @classmethod
    def from_str(cls, datestr):
        year, month, day = map(int, datestr.split("-"))
        return cls(year, month, day)

    # Define a class method from_datetime accepting a datetime object
    @classmethod
    def from_datetime(cls, datetime):
        return BetterDate(datetime.year, datetime.month, datetime.day)


# You should be able to run the code below with no errors:
today = datetime.today()
bd = BetterDate.from_datetime(today)
print(bd.year)
print(bd.month)
print(bd.day)
