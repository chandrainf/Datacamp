Understanding class definitions


Objects and classes consist of attributes (storing the state) and methods (storing the behavior).

Before you get to writing your own classes, you need to understand the basic structure of the class, and how attributes in the class definition relate to attributes in the object. In this exercise, you have a class with one method and one attribute, as well as the object of that class.
