Analyzing a data integration plan


You're a data analyst in a hospital that wants to make sure there is enough cough medicine should an epidemic break out. For this, you need to combine the historical health records with the upcoming appointments to see if you can detect a pattern similar to the last cold epidemic. Then, you need to make sure there is sufficient stock available or if the stock should be increased. To help tackle this problem, you created a data integration plan.

Which risk is not clearly indicated on the data integration plan?
