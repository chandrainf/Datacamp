Check the return type


Python's flexibility around data types is usually cited as one of the benefits of the language. It can occasionally cause problems though if incorrect data types go unnoticed. You've decided that in order to make sure your code is doing exactly what you want it to do, you will explicitly check the return types of all of your functions and make sure they are what you expect them to be. To do that, you are going to create a decorator that checks that the return type of the decorated function is correct.

Note: assert(condition) is a function that you can use to test whether something is true. If condition is True, this function doesn't do anything. If condition is False, this function raises an error. The type of error that it raises is called an AssertionError.

- Start by completing the returns_dict() decorator so that it raises an AssertionError if the return type of the decorated function is not a dictionary.

def returns_dict(func):
    # Complete the returns_dict() decorator
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        assert(type(result) == dict)
        return result
    return wrapper


@returns_dict
def foo(value):
    return value


try:
    print(foo([1, 2, 3]))
except AssertionError:
    print('foo() did not return a dict!')

-Now complete the returns() decorator, which takes the expected return type as an argument.

def returns(return_type):
        # Write a decorator that raises an AssertionError if the
        # decorated function returns a value that is not return_type
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            assert (type(result) == return_type)
            return result

        return wrapper

    return decorator


@returns(dict)
def foo(value):
    return value


try:
    print(foo([1, 2, 3]))
except AssertionError:
    print('foo() did not return a dict!')
