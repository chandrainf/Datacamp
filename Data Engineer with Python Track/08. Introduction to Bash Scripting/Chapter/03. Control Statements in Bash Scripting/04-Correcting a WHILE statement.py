Correcting a WHILE statement


There is a script placed in this directory which has a mistake in it. It is some code to modify some employee files, but only for the first 1000 employees. Do not attempt to run the script as the necessary files are not in this directory.

Using your knowledge of WHILE scripts, can you determine where the mistake is? What will happen if it runs?

You can find the code by using cat emp_script.sh to print it to the console.
