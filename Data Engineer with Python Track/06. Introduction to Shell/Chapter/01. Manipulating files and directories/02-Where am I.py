Where am I?


The filesystem manages files and directories (or folders). Each is identified by an absolute path that shows how to reach it from the filesystem's root directory: /home/repl is the directory repl in the directory home, while /home/repl/course.txt is a file course.txt in that directory, and / on its own is the root directory.

To find out where you are in the filesystem, run the command pwd (short for "print working directory"). This prints the absolute path of your current working directory, which is where the shell runs commands and looks for files by default.

Run pwd. Where are you right now?
