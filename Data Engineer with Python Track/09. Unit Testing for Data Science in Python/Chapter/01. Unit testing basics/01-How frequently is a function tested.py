Possible Answers

    - A function is tested just once during its life cycle, which is right after the first implementation.

    - A function is tested after the first implementation and then any time the function is modified, and this happens mainly when new bugs are found.

    - A function is tested after the first implementation and then any time the function is modified, which happens mainly when new bugs are found, new features are implemented or the code is refactored.

    - A function is tested every time the function is executed.

Answer : A function is tested after the first implementation and then any time the function is modified, which happens mainly when new bugs are found, new features are implemented or the code is refactored.
