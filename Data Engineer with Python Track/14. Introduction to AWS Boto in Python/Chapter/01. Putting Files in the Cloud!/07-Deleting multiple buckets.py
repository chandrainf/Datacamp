'''
Deleting multiple buckets


The Get It Done app used to be called Get It Made. Sam always thought it was a terrible name, but it got stuck in her head nonetheless.

When she was making the pipeline buckets, she used the gim- abbreviation for the old name. She decides to switch her abbreviation to gid- to accurately reflect the app's real (and better) name.

She has already set up the boto3 S3 client and assigned it to the s3 variable.

Help Sam delete all the buckets in her account that start with the gim- prefix. Then, help her make a 'gid-staging' and a 'gid-processed' bucket.

Instructions

- Get the buckets from S3.
- Delete the buckets that contain 'gim' and create the 'gid-staging' and 'gid-processed' buckets.
- Print the new bucket names.

'''
# Get the list_buckets response
response = s3.list_buckets()

# Delete all the buckets with 'gim', create replacements.
for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    if 'gim' in bucket['Name']:
        s3.delete_bucket(Bucket=bucket['Name'])

s3.create_bucket(Bucket='gid-staging')
s3.create_bucket(Bucket='gid-processed')

# Print bucket listing after deletion
response = s3.list_buckets()
for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    print(bucket['Name'])
