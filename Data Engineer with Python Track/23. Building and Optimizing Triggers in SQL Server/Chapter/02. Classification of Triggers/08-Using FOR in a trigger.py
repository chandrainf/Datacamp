Possible Answers

    - Using FOR makes the trigger be of a different type than AFTER and INSTEAD OF triggers.

    - FOR is a synonym of AFTER and performs the trigger's set of actions after the triggering event finishes.

    - FOR is a synonym of INSTEAD OF and performs the trigger's set of actions instead of the triggering statement.

    - The FOR clause can never be used in a trigger definition.

Answer : FOR is a synonym of AFTER and performs the trigger's set of actions after the triggering event finishes.
