'''
CREATE your first few TABLEs


You'll now start implementing a better database model. For this, you'll create tables for the professors and universities entity types. The other tables will be created for you.

The syntax for creating simple tables is as follows:

    CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_a data_type,
    column_b data_type,
    column_c data_type
    );
    
Attention: Table and columns names, as well as data types, don't need to be surrounded by quotation marks.
