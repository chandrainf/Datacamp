Scooter dispatch


The City Council were huge fans of Sam's prediction about whether scooter was blocking a sidewalk or not. So much so, they asked her to build a notification system to dispatch crews to impound scooters from sidewalks.

With the dataset she created, Sam can dispatch crews to the case's coordinates when a request has negative sentiment.

Scooter Dataframe

In this exercise, you will help Sam implement a system that dispatches crews based on sentiment and image recognition. You will help Sam pair human and machine for effective City management!

# Get topic ARN for scooter notifications
topic_arn = sns.create_topic(Name='scooter_notifications')['TopicArn']

for index, row in scooter_requests.iterrows():
    # Check if notification should be sent
    print(row.head)
    if (row['sentiment'] == 'NEGATIVE') & (row['img_scooter'] == 1):
        # Construct a message to publish to the scooter team.
        message = "Please remove scooter at {}, {}. Description: {}".format(
            row['long'], row['lat'],
            row['public_description'])

        # Publish the message to the topic!
