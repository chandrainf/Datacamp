Creating multi-level topics


The City Council asked Sam to create a critical and extreme topic for each department.

The critical topic will trigger alerts to staff and managers.

The extreme topics will trigger alerts to politicians and directors - it means the thresholds are completely exceeded.

For example, the trash department will have a trash_critical and trash_extreme topic.

She has already created the boto3 SNS client in the sns variable. She created a variable departments that contains a unique list of departments.

In this lesson, you will help Sam make the City run faster!

You will create multi-level topics with a different set of subscribers that trigger based on different thresholds.

You will effectively be building a smart alerting system!
