'''
Scala is object-oriented
Scala is an object-oriented language because every value is an object and every operation is a method call. This fact means the following lines of code both result in the value 6:

    val sumB = 2.+(4)
    val sumA = 2 + 4

The same principle applies to the subtraction operator (-), as operators are methods in Scala. In this exercise, you'll experience how Scala is object-oriented by converting code that Scala executes behind-the-scenes to the code you'll normally write in practice.

- Rewrite the provided subtraction code in standard arithmetic notation (e.g., 2 + 4).
- Print the difference using the println function.

'''
// Calculate the difference between 8 and 5
val difference = 8-5

// Print the difference
println(difference)
