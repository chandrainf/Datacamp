Possible Answers

    - SUBSTRING() returns some characters of a string from a start position and gets from that string as many characters as we specify in the length parameter.

    - SUBSTRING() returns the position of a substring in a string. We can optionally determine the position where the search will start.

    - CHARINDEX() returns the position of a substring in a string.

    - We can optionally pass to the CHARINDEX() function a parameter to determine the position where the search will start.
