Conforming with data types


For demonstration purposes, I created a fictional database table that only holds three records. The columns have the data types date, integer, and text, respectively.

    CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_date date, 
    amount integer,
    fee text
    );

Have a look at the contents of the transactions table.

The transaction_date accepts date values. According to the PostgreSQL documentation, it accepts values in the form of YYYY-MM-DD, DD/MM/YY, and so forth.

Both columns amount and fee appear to be numeric, however, the latter is modeled as text – which you will account for in the next exercise.

'''
-- Let's add a record to the table
INSERT INTO transactions(transaction_date, amount, fee)
VALUES('2018-09-24', 5454, '30')

-- Doublecheck the contents
SELECT *
FROM transactions
