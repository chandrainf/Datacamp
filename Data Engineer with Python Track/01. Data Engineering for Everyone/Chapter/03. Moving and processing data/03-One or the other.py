One or the other


You've seen that data can be processed in batches (records are grouped and processed at intervals) or streams (records are sent individually right away).

Can you correctly classify the actions on the right as being batched or streamed?

Some of these are tricky, you may have to think twice! Don't worry if you don't get it right the first time. All that matters is that you get the difference between batches and streams, so if you make a mistake, make sure to read the orange feedback messages at the bottom left to understand why!
