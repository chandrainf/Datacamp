Generate HTML table from Pandas


Residents often complain that they don't know the full range of services offered through the Get It Done application.

In an effort to streamline the communication between the City government and the public, the City Council asked Sam to generate a table of all the services in the Get It Done system.

The system is dynamic and grows on a weekly basis, adding additional services. Sam didn't want to waste time updating the file manually, and felt like she can automate the process.

She loaded the DataFrame of available services into the services_df variable:
