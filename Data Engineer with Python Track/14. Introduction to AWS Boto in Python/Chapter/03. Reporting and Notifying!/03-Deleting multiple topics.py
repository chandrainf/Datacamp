Deleting multiple topics


It's hard to get things done in City government without good relationships. Sam is burning bridges with the general topics she created in the last exercise.

People are shunning her because she is blowing up their phones with notifications.

She decides to get rid of the general topics per department completely, and keep only critical topics.

Sam has created the boto3 client for SNS and stored it in the sns variable.

Help Sam regain her status in the bureaucratic social hierarchy by removing any topics that do not have the word critical in them.
