A high-level view on CI/CD


You have made your managers aware of your progress with the data pipeline. Now they want you to prepare the code for production. To do so, you have created tests for various parts of your pipeline, so that if someone else changes the code, by simply running the unit tests it will immediately become clear if the newly introduced changes break the expected behavior.

Now you need to help configuring the CI/CD tool that is being used in your company. You need to instruct it to retrieve the code from your companyâ€™s internal version control system and run the pytest module automatically.
